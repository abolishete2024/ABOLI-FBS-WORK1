        <p><b>Rohit Sharma</b> is one of the most consistent and stylish batsmen in world cricket. He is popularly known as <i>"Hitman"</i> for his powerful hitting.</p>

        <p><b>Rohit Gurunath Sharma</b>, born on <b>30 April 1987</b> in Bansod, Nagpur, Maharashtra, is one of the greatest Indian cricketers of all time. A stylish right-handed opening batsman and part-time off-spinner, Rohit is famously known as the "<b>Hitman</b>" for his ability to hit big sixes with elegance and ease. He made his ODI debut for India in <b>2007</b> and Test debut in <b>2013</b>, and has since become one of the few players to dominate across all formats of the game. He holds the world record for the <b>highest individual score in ODI cricket</b> â€“ a staggering <b>264 runs</b> against Sri Lanka in 2014. Rohit is the <b>only player to score three double centuries in ODIs</b>, and has scored <b>five centuries in a single World Cup (2019)</b>, a record that still stands. In T20Is, he shares the record for the <b>most centuries (5)</b> and holds the record for <b>most sixes across all international formats combined</b>.</p>

        <p>Rohit has been a crucial part of the Indian cricket team for over 15 years, contributing with both the bat and his sharp cricketing brain. He was appointed full-time captain of India in all formats and successfully led the team to the <b>finals of multiple ICC tournaments</b>, including the <b>2023 ODI World Cup</b> and the <b>2024 T20 World Cup</b>, the latter of which India won under his captaincy. In the IPL, Rohit captained the <b>Mumbai Indians (MI)</b> to an incredible <b>five titles</b> (2013, 2015, 2017, 2019, 2020), making him the most successful IPL captain alongside MS Dhoni.</p>

        <p>Off the field, Rohit Sharma is known for his humble nature and strong support for wildlife conservation. He is actively involved with various campaigns and is also a brand ambassador for multiple national and international brands. For his outstanding contributions to Indian cricket, he has been honored with the <b>Arjuna Award in 2015</b> and the prestigious <b>Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna Award in 2020</b>. Rohit retired from T20 Internationals after the 2024 World Cup win and from Test cricket in 2025, leaving behind a glorious legacy. His journey from a middle-class boy in Mumbai to one of the most respected and loved cricketers in the world is nothing short of inspirational.</p>
